    "- In 1983, 90 percent of the U.S. news industry was owned and controlled by 50 different\n",
    "companies. \n",
    "- Thirty-four years later, 90 percent of American news coverag flows from just six media conglomerates\n",
    "- This affects how well the public perceives current events, due to a high degree of confirmation bias that veers toward groupthink.\n",

    "- DNN is a news platform that combines news creation with decentralized networks as a means to delivering factual content, curated by a community of readers, writers, and reviewers.\n",
    "- DNN's stack consists of Ethereum, IPFS, and ZeroNet.\n",
    "- DNN removes the need for advertisers because the platform will not source revenue from display ads. It uses its own token as a revenue model. \n",
    "- DNN’s system works to incentivize writers and reviewers, in a self-sustaining and autonomous environment\n",
    "- Compensation is derived from the community’s engagement, rather than external revenue streams such as native ads. \n",
    "- Open Source, transparent money, contributor controlled environment, \n",
    "- By persisting the contents of published articles to IPFS, and making references to these articles directly in ethereum smart contracts, they can ensure that every article is as immutable and everlasting as the ethereum network\n",
    "- The blockchain decentralizes authority to publish content on DNN. \n",
    "- There is no single source that controls the message and feel of published works,\n",
    "- DNN is not tethered to any special interests or political agendas, nor is it vying for a substantial chunk of ad revenue, which puts it in a category separate from most publications that are tied down to a bigger entity.\n",

    "- Articles are stored in IPFS (Decentralized file store)\n",
    "- Only a reference to the article is put away inside Ethereum (i.e. an IPFS hash pointer to the article).\n",
    "- So the hash pointer utilized for the article will be a reference to its total substance in IPFS.\n",

    "- ZeroNet is a decentralized web-like network of peer-to-peer users. \n",
    "-  Instead of having an IP address, sites are identified by a public key (specifically a bitcoin address).\n",
    "- The private key allows the owner of a site to sign and publish change, which propagate through the network. \n",
    "- Sites can be accessed through an ordinary web browser when using the ZeroNet application, which acts as a local webhost for such pages.\n",
    "- In addition to using bitcoin cryptography, ZeroNet uses trackers from the BitTorrent networkto negotiate connections between peer\n",
    "- ZeroNet works by seeding information — for this situation the DNN web application — to facilitating hubs that are occupied with utilizing the information.\n",
    "- Facilitating hubs, known as companions, download (\"siphon\") and transfer (\"seed\") the DNN web application between each other instead of through a brought together server. \n",
    "- All through the DNN, a huge number of facilitating hubs spread out crosswise over various land locales, containing complete duplicates of the whole DNN web application and making it accessible to intrigued watchers.\n",

    "- The DNN token is the essential instrument of significant worth that can be utilized to do activities on the stage. \n",
    "- For instance, essayists utilize DNN tokens to pay for the Writer Fee related with presenting their article to the system. \n",
    "- Once an article has been acknowledged, authors can procure DNN tokens through the engagement produced by their article.\n",
    "- Commentators utilize DNN tokens to be considered by the system as an analyst of a submitted article. \n",
    "- Perusers utilize DNN tokens to associate with articles through review, remarking, and tipping scholars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anyone can submit articles that will be reviewed by a handful of quasi-selected and anonymous contributors\n",
    "- During review, contributors check articles to ensure that they are in accordance with the network’s public set of editorial standards. \n",
    "- Each piece of news published on DNN is replicated across a series of community-hosted nodes and made available to the public. \n",
    "- Readers, writers, reviewers, and publishers earn tokens in proportion to the amount of positive contributions they make to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- DNN is comprised of four types of actors that each have key roles and contributions that together, make up the underlying functions and framework of the network\n",

    "#### WRITERS\n",
    "- Writers, or reporters, are individuals who submit news content in the form of articles. Whether\n",
    "- Since anyone can submit articles to DNN, getting published is not guaranteed.\n",
    "- To increase the chance of getting published writers should ensure that they closely comply with the DNN content guidelines to mitigate the chance of reviewers rejecting their piece due to infractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REVIEWERS\n",
    "- Reviewers, or editors, read and vote upon submitted articles before an article is available for public consumption on the DNN’s article feed. \n",
    "- The review process includes basic tasks such as noting grammatical errors, pointing out inaccuracies and questionable statements, as well as content classification.\n",
    "- Reviewers do not have the ability to modify articles, but rather can accept (i.e. vote to have content published) or reject (i.e. vote to prevent content from being published) any written piece\n",
    "-  To make sure that no single reviewer has the final say on whether or not an article should be publicly incorporated into the network, the network will assign seven random reviewers to validate the article. \n",
    "- The seven reviewers are chosen in a process called the Review Selection Bid\n",
    "- All seven reviewers are completely unaware of one another’s identities; they vote and leave feedback in complete isolation to avoid groupthink or any form of collusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### READERS\n",
    "- Readers can comment, add notes, share, tip, bookmark articles of interest, and denote articles they deem questionable. \n",
    "- readers on DNN play an active role in helping to shape the news they read, which includes participating in Reader Suggestions whereby article topics are put forward by you, the news consumer.\n",
    "- Readers pay for access in DNN tokens. \n",
    "- As Ethereum continues to improve scalability with additions like sharding, state channels, and plasma, an ideal way to implement a subscription model, a pay-per-article model, or a combination of the two will be explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PUBLISHERS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Publishers are server nodes which act as a proxy between human contributors and the DNN network residing on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "-  Specialized open source software consisting of the complete DNN contributor-interface and network interface, is bundled and installed on each publisher. \n",
    "- Publisher nodes are responsible for replicating published articles and ensuring that the DNN network remains available in the face of coordinated attacks.\n",
    "-  Publisher nodes communicate with one another through a peer-to-peer protocol that makes use of the same cryptography behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. \n",
    "- Using this peer-to-peer protocol, publishers are able to relay details about their state to nearby node hosts.\n",
    "- The main purpose for publishers is to provide an attack resistant transport for the DNN software, rather than host the DNN software on a centralized server, which introduces a significant point of failure.\n",
    "\n",

    "Find the code here https://github.com/dnnmedia/dnn_site_demo\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin working on DNN's alpha, you must first install all of the dependent node modules within package.json. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the repo and run the following command.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "npm install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, in the same directory, run server.js to start the demo.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "node server.js\n",
